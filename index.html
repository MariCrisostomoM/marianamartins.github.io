      <h2>Sobre mim</h2>
      <p>I am an undergraduate and graduate professor in the area of ​​computing and software engineering. I also work as a Project Manager and Requirements Engineer in Innovation and Artificial Intelligence (AI) projects. I strongly believe in building a better world through science and technology. As a strong team player, I persistently seek to achieve collective goals with a proactive, organized, results-oriented and creative effort. I am in my fourth year of a PhD in Computer Science (emphasis in Software Engineering) and I have completed a Master's degree in Computer Science (emphasis in Software Engineering), both from the Federal University of Goiás (UFG). I also have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the Federal University of Goiás. I am an Agribusiness Technician from the Federal Institute of Tocantins (IFTO). I have experience in Software Engineering, including managing Research, Development and Innovation (RDI) and AI projects, working in prototype development and validation, requirements gathering, backlog management and (agile) project management. In partnership with national collaborators, I published articles in scientific journals and conferences.</p>
